					In Short: We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining 
					information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise 
					when you contact us.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Personal Information Provided by You. The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions

					All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes 
					to such personal information.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>Information automatically collected</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					In Short: Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected 
					automatically when you visit our Services.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your 
					specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, 
					browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, 
					information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to 
					maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The information we collect includes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Log and Usage Data.</li>
					<p>
						Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect 
						when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log 
						data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity 
						in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other 
						actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports 
						(sometimes called "crash dumps" ), and hardware settings).

					</p>
					<br>
					<li>Device Data.</li>
					<p>
						We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the 
						Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), 
						device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or 
						mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.
					</p>
					<br>
					<li>Location Data.</li>
					<p>
						We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. 
						How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, 
						we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). 
						You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your 
						Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

				<h4>
					3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
				</h4>
				<br>
				<p>
					In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) 
					to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our 
					contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
				</p>
				<br>
				<b>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</b>
				<br>
				<p>
					The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your 
					personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:
				</p>                  
				<ul>
					<li>
						Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific 
						purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations 
						to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.
					</li>
					<li>Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests 
						and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information 
						for some of the purposes described in order to:
						<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
							<li>
								Analyze how our Services are used so we can improve them to engage and retain users
							</li>
							<li>
								Support our marketing activities
							</li>
							<li>
								Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate 
						with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in 
						which we are involved.
					</li>
					<li>
						Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third 
						party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<b>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</b>
				<br>
				<p>
					We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, 
					or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can <a href="#withdrawconsent">withdraw your consent</a> at any time.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely ways
					</li>
					<li>
						For investigations and fraud detection and prevention
					</li>
					<li>
						For business transactions provided certain conditions are met
					</li>
					<li>
						If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim
					</li>
					<li>
						For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
					</li>
					<li>
						If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
					</li>
					<li>
						If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the 
						collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province
					</li>
					<li>
						If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records
					</li>
					<li>
						If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes 
						for which the information was produced
					</li>
					<li>
						If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes
					</li>

						If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations

					if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional
